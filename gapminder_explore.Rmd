```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```


Making a story with the gapminder data:

```{r}
hist(gapminder$gdpPercap)
```

This is a histogram showing the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

```{r}
(summary(gapminder$gdpPercap))
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
p <- ggplot(filter(gapminder, continent != "Oceania"),
            aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp))
```

```{r}
p<- p + scale_x_log10()
p+geom_point()
```

I don't think this shows anything super inmportant. I was mainly playing around with making these plots.
